# Branch specific info:
This branch contains the code for Regex Source Generators. See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/44676 for motivation. Currently the work to set up the boilerplate for source generators has been done and a simple unit test has been set up as a starting point to drive the implementation. Starting with this branch should be easy: Just clone, build System.Text.RegularExpressions.sln and debug System.Text.RegularExpressions.Generator.Tests.Test.  The following work is pending:

1. Define the exact public API that the source generator exposes. In this branch, I have created a `RegexSourceGenerator` attribute that takes a pattern. The exact public API, once defined, will need to go through API review. However, this is not important right now to get started with the source generator implementation
2. A parser to parse RegexGenerator.cs:SyntaxReceiver.RegexFields and obtain the regex pattern.
3. Once the pattern is parsed, the source generator needs to produce a type that inherits from `Regex`. For ex: Given a pattern like "abcd", this looks similar to:

```csharp
// test1
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

internal class test1 : Regex
{
	public test1()
	{
		pattern = "abcd";
		roptions = RegexOptions.Compiled;
		factory = new test1Factory1();
		TimeSpan infiniteMatchTimeout = Regex.InfiniteMatchTimeout;
		((Regex)/*Error near IL_002d: Stack underflow*/).internalMatchTimeout = infiniteMatchTimeout;
		capsize = 1;
		InitializeReferences();
	}
}
```
4. The source generator also needs to produce the corresponding factory and runner methods. It should similar to:

```csharp
// test1Factory1
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

internal sealed class test1Factory1 : RegexRunnerFactory
{
	protected override RegexRunner CreateInstance()
	{
		return new test1Runner1();
	}
}

```
and 
```csharp
// test1Runner1
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

internal sealed class test1Runner1 : RegexRunner
{
	protected override void Go()
	{
		string text = runtext;
		int num = runtextend;
		int num2 = runtextpos;
		int start = num2;
		ReadOnlySpan<char> span = MemoryExtensions.AsSpan(text, num2, num - num2);
		if (3u < (uint)span.Length && MemoryMarshal.GetReference(span) == 'a' && System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.Add(ref MemoryMarshal.GetReference(span), 1) == 'b' && System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.Add(ref MemoryMarshal.GetReference(span), 2) == 'c' && System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.Add(ref MemoryMarshal.GetReference(span), 3) == 'd')
		{
			Capture(0, start, runtextpos = num2 + 4);
		}
	}

	protected override bool FindFirstChar()
	{
		int num = runtextpos;
		int num2 = runtextend;
		if (num <= num2 - 4)
		{
			string text = runtext;
			num += 3;
			while (num < num2)
			{
				int num3 = text[num];
				int num4;
				if (num3 != 100)
				{
					num3 -= 97;
					num4 = (((uint)num3 <= 3u) ? "\u0003\u0002\u0001\0"[num3] : '\u0004');
				}
				else
				{
					num3 = num;
					num3--;
					if (text[num3] == 'c')
					{
						num3--;
						if (text[num3] == 'b')
						{
							num3--;
							if (text[num3] == 'a')
							{
								runtextpos = num3;
								return true;
							}
						}
					}
					num4 = 1;
				}
				num = num4 + num;
			}
		}
		runtextpos = num2;
		return false;
	}

	protected override void InitTrackCount()
	{
		runtrackcount = 3;
	}
}

```
5. Add the emitted code to the current compilation.
6. Wire up the new source generated type to the Regex cache so the regex engine finds it? I haven't thought this through yet.
7. When the implementation is complete and we are ready to ship, the commit e0285cc3d20d960542a3997e9bf929a3d3249d8a (Add dependency on Lokad/ILPack to save assembly to disk) needs to be reverted.
